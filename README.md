I'm learning C# through this tutorial [Learn C# by Building a Simple RPG](https://scottlilly.com/learn-c-by-building-a-simple-rpg-index/). It uses Windows Forms to create a desktop application for the user interface.

## Lessons Learned
Visual Studio as an IDE is quite different from VS Code as far as the tooling and the types of projects you can create. It's quite overwhelming compared to what I'm used to, but I have to learn it since employers want you to know it. Besides the tooling difference in Visual Studio, I enjoy the tutorial so far.
